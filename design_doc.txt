this game doesn't have to be fun, just use it to learn how to manage larger projects, how to make art, sfx, vfx, music, etc...

Touhou 6 has 2 enemy types on the first level, but they each use a bunch of different paths, so follow that approach

TODO:
	boss base scene implementation
	
	make the level
	

Design the first level
	More paths
	Script the spawn points
	
	Once first level gameplay is finished, then start putting in your own art + music
	
Finish vertical slice of first level


Boss Design
	They will move to certain points, stay there and attack, once the attack ends, they will move again and do a different attack. Potentially could have several phases that depend on max health percentages remaining.
		

Setting
	Post-apocalyptic world w/ mechanical beings that have intertwined with an overgrowing city + environment. ( Think Nier Automata )
	
	Player is a female protag, with some mechanical parts ( similar to the legendary "P" ) ->>> P ORGAN POSSIBLE....
	


Types of enemies:
	
	
Develop a visual language:
	What colors mean what,
	what shapes, vfx, etc...
	
	
	
	
Lessons learned:
	Don't organize file structure like this, keep scene script and assets together in their own folder relating to a single entity
	try using composition next instead of inheritance (make your own godot nodes)
