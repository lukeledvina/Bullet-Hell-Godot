TODO:
	Power-ups that occasionally drop from enemies that are missable
		one type improves damage, size, etc. of player projectile
		another can build up to restore a life if you collect enough
		
		the purpose is to force the player to be constantly making decisions and weighing risk/reward, for potential long or short term benefit
		
		green -> 1/10 for life upgrade -> (max lives is 5)
		red -> adds dmg + small size increase, certain breakpoints make more noticable changes (max is 150, lose 5 on death that can be recollected (maybe))





Design the first level
	More types of enemies
	More paths
	Script the spawn points
	
	Boss enemy implementation
	
	Once first level is finished, then start putting in your own art + music
	
Once the general idea for the first level is in place for gameplay, art, and music, start working on other levels



Setting
	Post-apocalyptic world w/ mechanical beings that have intertwined with an overgrowing city + environment. ( Think Nier Automata )
	
	Player is a female protag, with some mechanical parts ( similar to the legendary "P" ) ->>> P ORGAN POSSIBLE....
	


Types of enemies:
	Who is our goomba?, a simple enemy that does not even shoot
	
	
Develop a visual language:
	What colors mean what,
	what shapes, vfx, etc...
