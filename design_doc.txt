Design the first level
	More types of enemies
	More paths
	Script the spawn points
	
	Boss enemy implementation
	
	Once first level is finished, then start putting in your own art + music
	
Once the general idea for the first level is in place for gameplay, art, and music, start working on other levels


Draw on paper enemy designs, then implement their gameplay, then make the actual pixel art for the game


Setting
	Post-apocalyptic world w/ mechanical beings that have intertwined with an overgrowing city + environment. ( Think Nier Automata )
	
	Player is a female protag, with some mechanical parts ( similar to the legendary "P" ) ->>> P ORGAN POSSIBLE....
	


Types of enemies:
	Who is our goomba?, a simple enemy that does not even shoot
	
	
Develop a visual language:
	What colors mean what,
	what shapes, vfx, etc...
