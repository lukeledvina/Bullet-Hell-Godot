this game doesn't have to be fun, just use it to learn how to manage larger projects, how to make art, sfx, vfx, music, etc...

Touhou 6 has 2 enemy types on the first level, but they each use a bunch of different paths, so follow that approach

It should probably be possible to kill all enemies

TODO:
	make the level ( less than 4 minutes long )
	
	boss health bar UI
	
	MAKE LARGER SPRITES (64x64, or larger)
	

Design the first level
	More paths
	Script the spawn points
	
	Once first level gameplay is finished, then start putting in your own art + music
	
Finish vertical slice of first level

Setting
	Post-apocalyptic world w/ mechanical beings that have intertwined with an overgrowing city + environment. ( Think Nier Automata )
	
	Player is a female protag, with some mechanical parts ( similar to the legendary "P" ) ->>> P ORGAN POSSIBLE....
		Flying a ship...
	

Develop a visual language:
	What colors mean what,
	what shapes, vfx, etc...
	
Lessons learned:
	Don't organize file structure like this, keep scene script and assets together in their own folder relating to a single entity
	try using composition next instead of inheritance (make your own godot nodes)


Potentials:
	Each enemy killed drops x amt of exp, at level breakpoints you can choose an upgrade (like vampire survivors)
